Ghost v1.0
----------

Then I first played World of Warcraft back in 2005 I wrote an
addon called AutoHideBar. I maintained it until TBC. Over the past
years I used Geist insted but then I started to play vanilla again
I wanted to use Geist, but it did't work. AutoHideBar felt very old
so I decided to wrote my own addon based on Geist and AutoHideBar.

The main reason I wanted to hide 25 buttons at the mouse pointer
is then you are playing mage you got tons of teleports and buff and
I did't want to clutter my interface with icons. This isso  much better.

hope you like my addon

best regards
Tugore.
