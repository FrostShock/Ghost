Ghost v1.0
----------

Then I first played World of Warcraft back in 2005, I wrote an
addon called AutoHideBar. I maintained it until TBC, until I dropped it
Over the past years I have used Geist, so then I started to play vanilla
Wow I wanted to use Geist, but it did't work. AutoHideBar felt very old
so I decided to wrote my own addon based on Geist and AutoHideBar.

This addon will create a hidden button bar, which you can show next to
the mouse cursor. It working just as a actionbar so you only need to
drag your spells to it. You can also add short-cuts to all spells.

I usely add all my buffs and non-combat spells to Ghost, so I can keep
all icons at a minimum.

hope you like my addon

Tugore.
